# handwriting

This repository contains all the application code for our Handwriting application.

Handwriting-Web is a ASP.NET C# application which we use as a front-end. It will handle
all user interactions.

Handwriting-Recognition is a flask application which acts as a microservice which we can call
on to classify, train, and test our various handwriting detection models.
